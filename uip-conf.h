 *
 * @remarks
 * 1. Nodes can use different buffer sizes, direct TCP communication is limited to the smallest
 *  ie: A RPi can be configured to use 1500byte TCP windows, with Arduino nodes using only 120byte TCP windows.
 * 2. Routing nodes handle traffic at the link-layer, so the MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE is not important, unless they are
 * running RF24Ethernet.
 * 3. Nodes running RF24Ethernet generally do not need to support RF24Network user payloads. Edit RF24Network_config.h
 *  and uncomment `#define DISABLE_USER_PAYLOADS`. This will free memory not used with RF24Ethernet.
 * 4. The user buffers are automatically configured to (Buffer Size - Link Layer Header Size - TCP Header Size) so
 * using RF24Mesh will decrease payloads by 14 bytes.
 * 5. Larger buffer sizes increase throughput for individual nodes, but can impact other network traffic.
 * 6. Max usable value is 512
